                    <p>I embarked on my professional journey in the fashion industry, specializing as a CAD-CAM Developer. For nearly a decade, I honed my skills and gained invaluable experience in this dynamic field. However, in 2013, I made a life-changing decision to relocate to South Florida. It was at this point that I recognized an opportunity to leverage my expertise from the fashion industry and apply it to the thriving marine industry in the region, which promised greater potential for growth and success.

                    With a determination to excel, I immersed myself in the marine industry, diligently learning about its unique dynamics and market demands over the course of five years while working for established companies. Equipped with a solid understanding of the market, I took a bold step and partnered with a business ally to establish our own small-scale business, providing specialized marine soft goods services for yachts. This venture proved to be a resounding success, instilling in me a newfound confidence and fueling my entrepreneurial spirit.This success also rekindled my long-standing passion for technology, which I had set aside for some time. Combining my creativity, business acumen, and technological prowess, I realized that I possessed a truly unique profile. Inspired by this realization, I decided to pursue my passion for tech, intertwining it with my extensive life and professional experience.</p>
